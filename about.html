As per ARAI’s new test cycle, it offers a mileage of 22.5kmpl. For reference, the redi-GO 0.8, which uses a 799cc, 3-cylinder engine delivering 54PS/72Nm, delivers a claimed mileage of 22.7kmpl.</p>

<h3>Ford Figo </h3>

<p> 
Ford introduced the Sportier ‘S’ version of the hatchback, the Ford Figo S, in April 2017. The Ford Figo Sports features a retuned suspension setup and bigger tyres for relatively better handling and stability, while mechanically, it remains the same. Also on offer are go-fast aesthetic additions such as a new mesh grill, dual-tone paint schemes, decals and red interior upholstery stitching and leather wrapped steering wheel. </p>

<h3>Hyundai Grand i10</h3>

<p> 
The biggest update that the Grand i10 received was under the hood. The diesel engine was upgraded from a 1.1-litre configuration to a 1.2-litre. As expected, the increase in cubic capacity resulted in more power. The new engine produces 75PS of power and 190Nm of torque. The 1.2-litre petrol engine, on the other hand, remains identical and produces 83PS/114Nm. </p>
